## Overview
This repository contains Postman collections designed for automated API testing, demonstrating both **happy path** and **negative scenarios**.

### Key Points:
- **Happy Path and Negative Testing:** Includes tests for missing authentication, invalid query parameters, and other negative scenarios.  
- **pm.test Scripts:** JavaScript tests implemented within the collection to validate API responses.  
- **Dynamic Variables:** All working variables in the collection are assigned to the environment to practice.  

### Important Notes:
- **Use Your Own API Key and Token:** All requests require your personal API credentials.  
- **Do Not Execute Without Environment:** Although it can run locally, the collection requires the environment for proper variable resolution.  
- **API Documentation Reference:** You may consult the API documentation for reference on request structure and responses.
