## Overview
This repository contains Postman collections demonstrating different approaches for API testing, focusing on fundamental data-driven execution and scripting.

### Collections:

1. **Static Data Collection**  
   - A simple collection using **static, duplicate data** for basic testing purposes.

2. **Data-Driven Collection**  
   - Uses an external data file (`post_data.json`) to drive multiple test iterations.

3. **Scripted Requests Collection**  
   - Includes **custom JavaScript tests** and pre/post-request scripts.
